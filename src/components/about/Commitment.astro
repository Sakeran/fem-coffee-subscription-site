        We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the
        way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best
        coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we
        want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
        challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with
        exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers through
        with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm
        community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the
        finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive
        to their native growing region.
